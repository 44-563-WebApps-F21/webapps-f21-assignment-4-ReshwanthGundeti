    <h4> _Morning-room at Sir Robert Chiltern’s house_.

        [LORD GORING, _dressed in the height of fashion_, _is lounging in an
        armchair_. SIR ROBERT CHILTERN _is standing in front of the fireplace_.
        _He is evidently in a state of great mental excitement and distress_.
        _As the scene progresses he paces nervously up and down the room_.]</h4>

    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech SIRROBERTCHILTERN">Yes; my wife is as perfect as all that.</p>

    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Taking off his left-hand glove_.]</p>
    <p class="speech LORDGORING">What a pity! I beg
        your pardon, my dear fellow, I didn’t quite mean that. But if what you
        tell me is true, I should like to have a serious talk about life with
        Lady Chiltern.</p>

    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech SIRROBERTCHILTERN"> It would be quite useless.</p>

    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
    <p class="speech LORDGORING"> May I try?</p>

    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech SIRROBERTCHILTERN">Yes; but nothing could make her alter her views.</p>

    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech LORDGORING"> Well, at the worst it would simply be a psychological
        experiment.</p>

    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.</h6>
    <p class="speech SIRROBERTCHILTERN">All such experiments are terribly dangerous.</p>

    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING.</h6>
    <p class="speech LORDGORING"> Everything is dangerous, my dear fellow. If it wasn’t so,
        life wouldn’t be worth living. . . . Well, I am bound to say that I think
        you should have told her years ago. </p>

    <h6 class="name">SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. </h6>
    <p class="speech SIRROBERTCHILTERN"> When? When we were engaged? Do you think she
        would have married me if she had known that the origin of my fortune is
        such as it is, the basis of my career such as it is, and that I had done
        a thing that I suppose most men would call shameful and dishonourable?</p>

    <h6 class="name">LORD GORING. </h6>
    <p class="stage-direction">[_Slowly_.] </p>
    <p class="speech LORDGORING"> Yes; most men would call it ugly names. There
        is no doubt of that.</p>
